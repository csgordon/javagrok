\section{Related Work}
There is a wealth of work on inferring interesting properties of existing code,
but most of these are focused on inferring properties suitable for checking.
Because our goal is not to prove absence of errors, but to simply infer correct
information that is useful to the developer, some flexibility is available to us
that is not possible for much of that work.

The most directly relevant work is Buse and Weimer's system for automatically
inferring documentation for conditions that will result in a Java method
throwing an exception \cite{autodoc}.  We use a modification of their
algorithm, and also perform several other analyses to provide a broader range
of information.

\subsection{Individual Analyses}
Some text for nullability.

Some text for mutability.

Some text for reference capture and leakage.

Buse and Weimer \cite{autodoc} automatically infer documentation for
exceptions, and the exception analysis in our work is directly based on the
refined version of {\sc Jex} [citation needed] they present.
